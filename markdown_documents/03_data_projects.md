01 - Data Projects
==================

This page contains a variety of small data projects. They should be
considered as important initial steps in the final analysis that you
will be conducting for the client.

I will assign each one to a specific person, and I will post your
results in the poster of the repository.

<br>

1.  **Miao** Generate a comprehenslive list of REITs. There is a
    spreadsheet in the data sets page that can serve as a good starting
    point for this.

2.  **Zixuan** Generate a comprehensive list of REIT related indexes.
    The FTSE NAREIT Index, is one example, can you find others?

3.  **Ki** wis the total market cap of FTSE NAReit Index? What is the
    market cap of; 1) residential reits, 2) commercial reits, 3)
    residential mReits, 4) commercial mReits. Get time series for each
    of thes data and visualize this over time.

4.  **Arthur** A good list of publicly traded REITs:
    <https://www.reitnotes.com/list-of-public-reits/p/1>
    
      - Someone needs to go through an manually convert these over to a
        CSV file

5.  **Weizhong** Generate a graph of the cummulative performance of
    REITs with other non-REIT indexes: US Large Cap Equities, Russell
    3000, Wilshire 5000, S\&P GSCI Index, Bloomberg Commodity Index, and
    DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index, Barclays Aggregate
    Bond.

6.  Low interest rate volatility is good for REITs. Can we observe this
    in the data?

7.  See if we can replicate the historcical compound total returns
    matrix in:
    <https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/mortgage-reits-combine-current-income-long-term-total-return-and>

8.  Can we replicate te 20-year total return graph in:
    <https://seekingalpha.com/article/4274191-untold-truth-mortgage-reit-investments>

9.  Some ways to modify the analysis in:
    <https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/reit-performance-under-different-macro-conditions>
    
      - perform the analysis with different economic indicators
    
      - perform the analysis with different subsector of REIT indexes
