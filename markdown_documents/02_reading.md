#### Pritamâ€™s Notes (1/20/2020):

I read the above articles and generated a list questions, and potential
starter data analysis projects that you can perform.

1.  Data Project: Low interest rate volatility is good for REITs. Can we
    observe this in the data?

2.  Data Project: Spread between mortgage rate and treasuries (or
    libor). Can we see this in the data?

3.  What is the privaleged tax status that REITs enjoy?(Good question
    for Patrick.)

4.  Data Project: what is the total market cap of FTSE NAReit Index?
    What is the market cap of; 1) residential reits, 2) commercial
    reits, 3) residential mReits, 4) commercial mReits. Visualize this
    over time.

5.  See if we can replicate the historcical compound total returns
    matrix in:
    <https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/mortgage-reits-combine-current-income-long-term-total-return-and>

6.  Data Project: Generate a graph of the cummulative performance of
    REITs with other non-REIT indexes: US Large Cap Equities, Russell
    3000, Wilshire 5000, S\&P GSCI Index, Bloomberg Commodity Index, and
    DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index, Barclays Aggregate
    Bond.

7.  Description of Three Major Commodity Indexes:
    <https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/commodities/a-look-at-three-major-commodity-index-etfs-21122018>

8.  What are some simple screens that you would perform on a REIT
    investment strategy? (Good question for Patrick)

9.  Ask Patrick about his interest in equity REITs vs mortgage REITs.

10. Annaly Capital Management - this is a blue chip residential mREIT.

11. Data Project: Can we replicate te 20-year total return graph in:
    <https://seekingalpha.com/article/4274191-untold-truth-mortgage-reit-investments>

12. Good glossary of REIT terms:
    <https://www.reit.com/what-reit/glossary-reit-terms>

14: Factor Investing in REITs (looking at some of this literature may be
a good way of thinking of quantitative ways of approaching REIT
    data):

  - <https://www.osam.com/Commentary/factor-alpha-approach-to-reits>

  - <https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2019/11/08/a-factor-based-approach-to-reit-investing>

  - <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3458308>

<!-- end list -->

15. A good list of publicly traded REITs:
    <https://www.reitnotes.com/list-of-public-reits/p/1>

<!-- end list -->

  - Someone needs to go through an manually convert these over to a CSV
    file

<!-- end list -->

16. Data Project: Some ways to modify the analysis in:
    <https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/reit-performance-under-different-macro-conditions>

<!-- end list -->

  - perform the analysis with different economic indicators

  - perform the analysis with different subsector of REIT indexes

<!-- end list -->

17. Data Project: Generate a comprehensive list of REIT related indexes,
    and then see if we can find historical price, return, and total
    return data for these indexes. The FTSE NAREIT Index, can you find
    others?

18. Data Project: Generate a comprehenslive list of REITs and then see
    if we can find historical price, return, and total return data for
    these indices. There is a spreadsheet in the data sets page that can
    serve as a good starting point for this.
